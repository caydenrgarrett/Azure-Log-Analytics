| project TimeGenerated, FunctionName, Level, Message, Properties
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### 2. Error Rate Analysis

```kusto
// Calculate success and failure rates by function
FunctionAppLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(7d)
| where Category == "Function.Execution"
| extend Status = case(
    Level == "Error" or Level == "Critical", "Failed",
    Level == "Information" and Message contains "executed successfully", "Success",
    "Other"
)
| summarize 
    TotalExecutions = count(),
    SuccessfulExecutions = countif(Status == "Success"),
    FailedExecutions = countif(Status == "Failed"),
    SuccessRate = round(countif(Status == "Success") * 100.0 / count(), 2)
    by FunctionName
| order by FailedExecutions desc
```

### 3. Error Pattern Detection

```kusto
// Identify recurring error patterns
FunctionAppLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(24h)
| where Level == "Error" or Level == "Critical"
| extend ErrorType = extract(@"Error: (.*?)(?:\n|$)", 1, Message)
| summarize 
    ErrorCount = count(),
    UniqueErrors = dcount(Message),
    FirstOccurrence = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastOccurrence = max(TimeGenerated)
    by FunctionName, ErrorType
| where ErrorCount > 1
| order by ErrorCount desc
```

### 4. Performance Monitoring

```kusto
// Monitor function execution duration and performance
FunctionAppLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(24h)
| where Category == "Function.Execution"
| where Message contains "Duration:"
| extend Duration = extract(@"Duration: (\d+\.?\d*)", 1, Message, typeof(real))
| summarize 
    AvgDuration = avg(Duration),
    MaxDuration = max(Duration),
    MinDuration = min(Duration),
    P95Duration = percentile(Duration, 95),
    ExecutionCount = count()
    by FunctionName
| order by AvgDuration desc
```

### 5. Security Event Monitoring

```kusto
// Monitor security-related events and anomalies
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(24h)
| where EventID in (4624, 4625, 4634) // Logon events
| summarize 
    TotalEvents = count(),
    UniqueUsers = dcount(Account),
    FailedLogons = countif(EventID == 4625)
    by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### 6. Resource Utilization Analysis

```kusto
// Analyze resource usage patterns
Perf
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(24h)
| where CounterName in ("% Processor Time", "Available MBytes", "Disk Read Bytes/sec")
| summarize 
    AvgValue = avg(CounterValue),
    MaxValue = max(CounterValue),
    MinValue = min(CounterValue)
    by CounterName, Computer
| order by CounterName, AvgValue desc
```

### 7. Anomaly Detection

```kusto
// Detect unusual patterns in function execution
FunctionAppLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(7d)
| where Category == "Function.Execution"
| summarize HourlyExecutions = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h), FunctionName
| extend 
    AvgHourlyExecutions = avg(HourlyExecutions) over (FunctionName),
    StdDevHourlyExecutions = stdev(HourlyExecutions) over (FunctionName)
| extend AnomalyScore = abs(HourlyExecutions - AvgHourlyExecutions) / StdDevHourlyExecutions
| where AnomalyScore > 2 // Flag as anomaly if more than 2 standard deviations
| order by AnomalyScore desc
```
